            <h1>For Snehal, My Best Friend & My Heart</h1>
        </header>
        <section class="intro">
            <p>Dear Snehal,</p>
            <p>I’ve been thinking for a while now about how to express everything I feel for you, and I realized that words will never fully capture what you mean to me. But I’ll try my best.

From the very first moment we met, I felt something special. You came into my life like a soft breeze, calm and gentle, yet with the power to change everything. For the past eight months, you’ve not only been my best friend, but also my greatest support, my laughter, and the reason my days are brighter.

You have this incredible way of making the simplest moments feel magical. Whether we’re just sitting together, talking about anything and everything, or laughing about the silliest things, every moment with you feels like a gift. Your smile, the way your eyes light up when you talk, the way you care so deeply—it all makes me fall for you more and more with each passing day.

And as much as I cherish the bond we’ve shared as best friends, I can’t help but feel that there’s something more growing between us. A love that has slowly woven itself into my heart, as warm and comforting as the softest blanket on a cold evening.

Snehal, I want to thank you for being the amazing person you are. For your kindness, your laughter, your beauty—both inside and out. You’ve brought a warmth to my life that I never even knew I needed, and I want to keep nurturing this warmth, this bond, and this love.

I guess what I’m trying to say is this: these eight months have been the happiest months of my life because of you, and I’d love nothing more than to see where this journey can take us. With all my heart, I hope we can create even more memories, share even more laughs, and build something beautiful together.

You are more than just my best friend—you are the one who makes my heart beat a little faster every time I see you. And I can’t imagine my life without you in it...</p>

            <p>Snehal,
I can’t help but smile every time I think of the memories we’ve created together. From meeting outside Legal Edge Coaching to our little trips to the restaurants, each moment was filled with joy and laughter. I’ll never forget the day we went to that temple, and you lost your shoes—what a funny and unexpected adventure that turned out to be! Every time we shared a meal or walked together, it felt like time stood still.
But the most precious moment of all was the note you gave me on my birthday. It was the sweetest gift I’ve ever received, and I’ll treasure it forever. Every memory with you is etched in my heart, and I look forward to making so many more. Thank you for being my best friend, my happiness, and my greatest gift.
With all my love,
[TuTu]...</p>
